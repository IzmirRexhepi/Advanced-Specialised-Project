# Week 1 Progress Log (19.05.2025 Date – 25.05.2025)

## Learning Style Reflection

---

## Goals Completed
- **Set up Miro for planning and system design**  
  Created a shared Miro board to map out multiplayer architecture ideas, backend flow, and general planning visuals.
- **Set up GitHub repository and folder structure**  
  Initialized the repo with folders for `godot-project/`, `backend/`, `docs/`, `weekly-progress/`, and `media/`. Included `.gitignore` specific to Godot.
- **Set up GitHub Wiki**  
  Created initial Wiki pages for architecture, tooling, and project planning documentation.
- **Set up Codecks board and project decks**  
  Created decks for weekly planning, added cards for setup tasks, and tracked completion status.
- **Prepared weekly progress reporting template**  
  Structured `weekly-progress/week1.md` to log goals, outcomes, and reflections weekly.
- [Brief notes on what you did — technical, planning, or research]

## Learning / Insights
- Learned GitHub Wiki setup for flexible documentation
- Got familiar with using Miro for visual planning and diagrammin systems.
- Codecks is helpful for linking tasks directly to week goals but needs to be assigned in scrumsf for better time managemnets.

## Decisions Made
- Will use **Godot 4.4.1** version for front-end

## Next Week Goals
- Research multiplayer architectures (Client-Server, P2P, Lockstep)
- Research and compare Nakama vs. OpenMatch
- Decide on backend tech stack
- Write initial architecture plan in `docs/api-design.md`
- Set up local backend development environment

## Notes / Reflection
- Week 1 was productive in setting the foundation.
- Wiki and Codecks together improved planning clarity.
- Excited to begin prototyping next week!
